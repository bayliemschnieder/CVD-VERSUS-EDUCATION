### Project Description:
The purpose of this project is to better understand the relationship between state education ranking and chronic health instances. According to the Insitute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, eighteen years of education can reduce the risk of death by thirty-four percent and is comparable to eating a lifelong healthy diet. Using this information we would like to explore the chronic illnesses most prominent in states with poorly ranked public education systems overall. This includes information not only from K-12 rankings, but also from university level rankings.

For this project specifically, we decided to hone in on cardiovascular disease and determine whether or not state education has an impact on rates of cardiovacular disease. We chose cardiovascular disease because, as of 2022, it was responsible for 1 in every 5 deaths in America. Understanding chronic diseases like this helps to better address and treat them. The cleaned data for this project contains information from school rankings in 2021, as well as cardiovascular disease reporting from 2021.
