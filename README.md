### DW-Project Description:
The purpose of this project is to better understand the relationship between state education ranking and chronic health instances. According to the Insitute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, eighteen years of education can reduce the risk of death by thirty-four percent and is comparable to eating a lifelong healthy diet. Using this information we would like to explore the chronic illnesses most prominent in states with poorly ranked public education systems overall. This includes information not only from K-12 rankings, but also from university level rankings.
